Deception is the most important tool for baseball pitchers, and yet it is simultaneously one of the most difficult to quantify. Tunneling is the method through which two different pitches move through the same "tunnel" for a breif moment out of the pitcher's hand, thus giving the illusion to the batter that they are the same pitch.

This project attempts to measure pitchers' tunnelling quality based off of radar data.
